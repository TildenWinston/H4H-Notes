Heaven and Hell.
THERE is beyond the Sky
A Heav'n of Joy and Love;
And holy Children when they die
Go to that World above.
There is a dreadful Hell,
And everlasting Pains;
There Sinners must with Devils dwell
In Darkness, Fire and Chains.
Can such a Wretch as I
Escape this cursed End?
And may I hope whene'er I die
I shall to Heav'n ascend?
Then will I read and pray,
While I have Life and Breath;
Lest I should be cut off to-day,
And sent t' eternal Death.
