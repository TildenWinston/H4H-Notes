## Final Exam Review

Exam will be fill in the blank, prompt and a box, fill in as we go

Final will be a lot like the make-up midterm

# Exam Practice (2020)

##### 1. Predict the class for the following: #----------

class(unlist(strsplit("R is angry and must be propitiated!","\\W")))
# Character Vector

class(length(letters))

class(class(class))

class(cbind(x=1:5,y=10:14))
class(x=1:5)
class(c(1,2,3,4,5)) # Numeric

class(dim(rbind(x=(1:5),y=10:14)))

mymatrix<-rbind(x=(1:5),y=10:14)
class(cbind(mymatrix,letters[1:2])) # Matrix of characters

class((rbind(x=(1:5),y=10:14)))
class(data.frame(rbind(x=(1:5),y=10:14)))

# Grabs 3rd column, same as [,3]
class(data.frame(rbind(x=1:5,y=10:14))[1:2,3]) # subsetting, tricky

df<-data.frame(x=1:5,y=10:14,z=letters[1:5],stringsAsFactors = F)
class(df[2,])
class(df[1:2,])
class(as.matrix(df[,1:2]))
class(df[,1:2])

class(df[,2])
class(df[[3]][2]) # bonus, predict what is returned
# df[[3]] returns the third column as character vector
# double bracket looks for columns 

class(df[2,3]) #rows then columns

df[[3]]
df[,3]
df$z
class(df[,3])

class(is.na(df[,3][6])) # logical

dim(df)
col3<-df[,3]
class(col3[6]) # character, even though col3[6] is NA

# Going a little beyond the exam
test.m<-matrix(c(2,3,NA,7,NA,2,3,14),4,2)
class(test.m[1,2]) # aaaRgh!!!
class(NA)

##### 2.Predict the output for each line of code

nchar("Emma") # Counts characters

length(c("Emma","Jane","Harriet"))

# Can only table a vector
table(c(letters[1:5],LETTERS[1],c("b","b"))) # Returns counts alphabetized, 

which(letters=="") # integer(0), probably will not be on exam, nothing with the flavor of integer
which(letters=="c") # returns 3

dim(matrix(1:8,2,4)) # 2 rows 4 columns

little.m<-matrix(1:8,2,4)
little.m[2,2] # 4

##### 3. Replace NAs in test.m with zeroes: #----------
# This would be on the open book part of the exam
# test.m is matrix from earlier


test.m[which(is.na(test.m))] <- 0
# OR
test.m[is.na(test.m)] <- 0

# OR
test.m[3,1] <- 0
test.m[1,2] <- 0


test.m


#Count the number of twos in the mtrix
length(which(test.m==2))

##### 4. Turn the following code snippets into functions: #----------

x<-c(1,3,NA,6)

sum(is.na(x))


# Rewrite this procedure as a function for finding number of NAs in any vector:
# not on exam
howmanyNAs <- function(x){sum(is.na(x))}
howmanyNAs(x)

x / sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)

# as a function for returning weights in any vector:

weights <- function(data){data / sum(data, na.rm = TRUE)}


# Try the first function on the vector a, the second on the vector b

a<-c(NA,1:2,NA,3:4)
howmanyNAs(a)

b<-sample(1:10,5) # Runs randomly, so different data will be returned
weights(b)

##### 5. Can you hack this? #----------
# Find below some tankas from Harryette Mullen (first two) and Sadakichi Hartmann
# The Japanese tanka is a thirty-one-syllable poem, 
# traditionally written in a single unbroken line. A form of waka, 
# Japanese song or verse, tanka translates as "short song."

# Turn these into bags of words. Using intersect(), find words that Mullen, a modern 
# African-American poet, is drawing from the tradition.

# Can you get sentiment scores for these?

tanka1<-"Awakened too early on Saturday morning 
by the song of a mockingbird 
imitating my clock radio alarm.
*
Walking along the green path with buds 
in my ears, too engrossed in the morning news
to listen to the stillness of the garden."

tanka2<-"Don't need picket fences, brick wall, 
or razor wire. Our home's protected by 
prickly pear cactus and thorny bougainvillea.
*
Native or not, you're welcome in our gardens. 
Lavender's dress is not so vibrant as your 
green trousers and purple velour sleeves."

tanka3<-"Winter? Spring? Who knows? 
White buds from the plumtrees wing 
And mingle with the snows. 
No blue skies these flowers bring, 
Yet their fragrance augurs Spring." 

tanka4<-"Oh, were the white waves, 
Far on the glimmering sea 
That the moonshine laves, 
Dream flowers drifting to me,--
I would cull them, love, for thee"

tanka5<-"Moon, somnolent, white, 
Mirrored in a waveless sea, 
What fickle mood of night 
Urged thee from heaven to flee 
And live in the dawnlit sea?" 

tanka6<-"Like mist on the leas, 
Fall gently, oh rain of Spring 
On the orange trees 
That to Ume's casement clingâ€”
Perchance, she'll hear the love-bird sing." 

tanka7<-"Though love has grown cold 
The woods are bright with flowers, 
Why not as of old 
Go to the wildwood bowers 
And dream of--bygone hours!"

tanka8<-"The morning wren sings
I stand in the moonlit dawn
Kimono wrapped close
Last night I made my peace
Now free from all attachments."


# unlist(strsplit(tanka1, "\\W")))
# 
# 
# tankabags.l <- list()
# 
# tankas <- c(tanka1, tanka2, tanka3, tanka4, tanka5, tanka6, tanka7, tanka8)
# 
# for(i in 1:8){
#   bagofwords <- tolower(unlist(strsplit(tankas[i], "\\W")))
#   tankabags.l[[i]] <- bagofwords
# }
# 
# intersect(tankabags.l[[1]], tankabags.l[[2]])


mullentankas <- c(tanka1, tanka2)
othertankas <- c(tanka3, tanka4, tanka5, tanka6, tanka7, tanka8)

intersect()

Reduce(intersect, tankabags.l)


##### 6. SHOW ME YOUR ABILITY TO REALLY HACK! #----------
# Harder than the exam

# Wheel of Fortune Before & After
# Write a function that takes two strings, e.g.
s1<-"wheel of fortune"
s2<-"fortune cookie"
# and returns the solution to a "Before and After" puzzle:
# "wheel of fortune cookie"
# Use your function to combine all the phrases in beforeandafters.txt

# Find point of overlap and use that to concatenate

# Need to string split
s1 <- unlist(strsplit(s1, "\\W"))

cat(s1[1:(length(s1)-1)], s2)

bandfs <- scan("beforeafter.txt")

beforeafter <- function(s1, s2){
  s1 <- unlist(str_split(s1, boundary("word")))
  s2 <- unlist(str_split(s2, boundary("word")))
  phrase <- paste(c(s1, s2[-which(s2 %in% s1)]), collapse = " ")
  return(phrase)
}

beforeafter(s1, s2)

```
