## R Jane Austen - Emma

Handsome, Clever, Rich

Tripplets/tripods
2 things close and one thing less connected

Evernone of importance is introduced early

Emma is opposite of Miss Bates

30,000 pounds is almost 3 million pounds today

Emma remakes Harriet
  Clueless - 1990s Harriet
  
Harriet is described as pretty by Emma as beautiful, but this is contrasted by others. (Knightly)

Most people in Jane Austen novels are people of leasure

Jane Austen builds complex social structures

![alt text here](class22-table.png)

Mr. Martin is the love interest of Harriet
  Harriet thinks him clever, but Jane disagrees
  
## Emma trying to arrange Harriet with Mr. Elton

Emma seems to be a good fit with Frank Churchhill
but, we still don't know much about him, he doesn't show up in first volume

## Free Indirect Discourse
Combines
*Tone* and *word order* from direct discourse
*Tense* and *person* from indirect discourse

Very common in 19th century novels, almost takes over.

## Sentiment over time
Low points of embarassment

## There is a lot of triviality in Jane Austen novels
Especially in Emma
  No real concerns
  
Some read Jane Austen for comfort, but there is a sense of unease
  Mr. Woodhouse as a terribly disfunctional character, fails to see the perspective of others
  
  Jane Austin lived through the french revolution and had brothers in the military, was the more radical?
  
  
Emma is seen as one of her most polished works, possibly one of her best.

## Free indirect discourse
hard to tell who is talking.

narrator isn't saying everything

Indirect
He had returned to a late dinner after some days absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick-Square.

Direct
"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightly...
But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sign, and saying: "Ah! Poor Miss Taylor. She would be very glad to stay."

Vol. 1, Chapter 5
Things shift into Dialogue, almost play like.

Free Indirect Discourse
Four Standard Examples:

* How was she going to bear the change? (1.i, p.6)
* The wont of a miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.


We often hear the voice of gossip - not a specific name
More complicated Examples of Quasi-Direct Discourse

* "I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill had written to Mrs. Weston?" (1.ii, p. 15) [Who says this? - the voice of gossip] - doxa
    * spoken, but not by anybody

* "He had gone three miles one day, in order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them - and in everything else he was do very obliging!.. (I.iv, p.23) [Indirect quotation?]
  * Emma taking role of narrator,  but still can't remove quotation marks


Easier to capture dialog in texts, harder with free and indirect discourse
Not perfect either way

Finding style of each character

Jane Austen as regulated hatred
